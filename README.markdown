Twitter user name will be used on the tweet button at the end of every post. G+, facebook, added, Pinterest and others might be added on future releases.

To set up the "archives" page, create a new page and assign the “archives” template to it, name the page whatever you like, but “Archives” might be a good choice lol, then go to `Appearance => Theme Options`, and look for “Archives Page”, ad the page of the name you just created and you are done.

Use `<pre></pre>` for large code blocks, or use `<code></code>` for bits of code witting your copy. NEW!! syntax highlighting via google code prettify, see documentation here

This theme provide an tables.css wich allows a very powerful table handling,  it was originally created by the smashing magazine guys, I added a new table CSS engine, thanks to the Twitter Bootstrap guys briefly modified by myself , you can find the documentation here.

A basic usage is:

`<table class="table-bordered"></table>`

And you can use or combine the following classes too:

* table-bordered
* table-striped
* table-condensed
